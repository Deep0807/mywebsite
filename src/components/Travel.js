          The state of Uttarakhand has released new travel guidelines
          considering the ongoing situation of Covid-19 pandemic. While the
          Government lifted most of the travel restrictions in several phases
          post Covid-19 lockdown, the second wave of Covid in Uttarakhand has
          made the Government rethink on travel guidelines. In a bid to deal
          with the second onslaught of Coronavirus, the Government has issued
          new restrictions on traveling and fines for rule-breaking. Given below
          are the intra-state and inter-state travel guidelines for Uttarakhand.
          The information is subject to change as per the updates issued by the
          Uttarakhand Government.
